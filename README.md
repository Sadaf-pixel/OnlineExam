# OnlineExam

This portal is "Online Examination Portal". I have made this as my 6th sem Software Enginneering Lab exam as to describe how the system of Online Examination works. I have defined the path to navigate the portal.
There are 3 main profiles - 1. Student 2.Teacher 3. Admin
To access Student Dashboard and give online test - Login/SignUp -> Student Dashboard -> Exam -> Online Exam -> Allow Camera and Microphone Acess -> Capture Image -> Proceed with the exam -> Take Exam -> Submit.
To access Teacher Dashboard - Login/SignUp -> Teacher Dashboard.
To access Admin Dashboard - Login/SignUp -> Admin Dashboard.
